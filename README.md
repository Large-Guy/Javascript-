# Javascript++

Many people agree that C++ 🤮 is a miserable language to work in, but you know what isn't?



That's right, ***😎 Javascript! 😎***



So that is why I have created the greatest, C++ library. It allows you to write code in a similar syntax to Javascript, the most beloved programming language with zero known issues!


## Benifits ☺️

- It's 😎 Javascript 😎!
- ⚡Blazingly fast⚡ speeds, as it is still compiled as C++ 🤮!
- Super easy to add to a project! (Just include javascript.h!)
- C++ 🤮 functions are still avaliable! (I don't see why you'd use them though.)

## Downsides 😞

- It's not a perfect implementation of Javascript.


As you can see, there is only one downside to 4 benifits! So why wouldn't you use it!
